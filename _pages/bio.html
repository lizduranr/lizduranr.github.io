      In 2012 I worked on a project "Corazón Pacifico" with Oxfam ong to
      teach photography to indigenous communities like the Embera of
      Chigorodó, the Awa of Pasto and Afro communities in Chocó, so that
      they learn to show people their costrumbres, culture and how they
      live in their communities. With photos of them a calendar for 2013
      was performed.
